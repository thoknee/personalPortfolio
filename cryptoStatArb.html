        <h1 class="header">Crypto Statistical Arbitrage</h1>
        <p>This is the outline to a crypto currency statistical arbitrage strategy that 
            I have been working on recently. It takes inspiration and follows "Statistical Arbitrage within Crypto Markets using PCA"
            By Jay Jung with some tweaks that have led to more successful returns and sharpe ratio
            even in recent years (2023 - 2025)
            <br> <br>

                The strategy remains quite simple and a staple in quantitative trading.
                The idea is to find crypto currencies that move together and look for where 
                they might diverge banking on a mean reversal looking to extract some kind
                of arbitrage. 
                <br> <br>

                Evidently, this strategy has been widely used in stocks since the beginning
                of quantitatively looking at stocks. Crypto, as Jung optimistically points out 
                is still a market full of inefficiencies that we will try to capitalize on.

            <h2>Version 1</h2>

            <br>

            <h3>Data</h3>

            The first step as with any project is to get the data. I decided on getting 500 
            highest volume crypto currencies in the last 3 years. From here I cleaned out 
            all stable coins but decided not to enact the other methodolgies Jung outlined 
            for the initial simple backtest. 

            <br><br>
            
            For the first most simple backtest, I did not incorporate any dynamic
            universe. I simply found the cointegration of every pair of coins and ranked 
            them based on their p value and t-stat.

            <br><br>


            <h3>Trading</h3>

            Upon obtaining the pairs of coins with the lowest t stat and a p-value as near 0
            as possible it was time to create positions based on the coins.

            I opted for a simpler version of what Jung outlined and instead looked at
            the average of a pair of coins and the z score the coin price. If there 
            was a zscore of greater than 2, you would short the coin and a z-score less than -2 
            would trigger a long. 

            <br><br>

            <h3>Results</h3>

            This very simple strategy with no universe rebalancing gave a sharpe ratio for 
            July 2024 - July 2025 of 1.54 after fees. This is surprisngly a pretty good sharpe ratio but would 
            most likely not hold up in practice. In this version the cointegration 
            lookback window was just all the data up until July 2024. In this particular
            case it is likely that we just got lucky and cointegration remained for a majority 
            of these coins for the following year.
            <br><br>
            The return graph looked like this: 
            <br><br>
            <img src="/img/cryptoStatArb_1.png" alt="First Simple Strategy Returns" width="600"/>
            <br><br>
            This is not a good backtest by any means but rather a framework for what I want this strategy will 
            be built on. Some next steps is to continue to omit coins that slow down in trading, making 
            sure trading volume is high enough, and account for negative shock.
            
            <br><br>

            Furthermore, to add universe rebalancing and a reasonable lookback window 
            that the cointegration can use.
