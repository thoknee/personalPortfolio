        <p>This is a streamlit project that goes through ways to price options. It includes the binomial 
            tree, monte carlo simulations, and the black-scholes merton model as 3 different ways to price 
            options.
            The deployed website is at: <a href = "https://derivativepricing.streamlit.app" target = "_blanke">Option Pricer</a>
            <br>
            The code can be found:

        <h2>Binomial Tree Model Pricing</h2>
        <p>Binomial tree option pricing is the most simple form of pricing options. It assumes that any stock can go up and down 
            a calculated amount with a calculated probability. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            When looking at the binomial option calculation,
            if you input a step count of less than 10 you can view the the entire price tree.
            <br>
            <br>
            To compare alongside the monte carlo simulation and black scholes, let's keep a common input that we can compare prices at the end.
            For this, we will have the following:

            Spot price = $100
            Strike price = $110
            Time to expiry = 1 year
            Risk free rate: 5%
            Volatility: 0.2

WWith these inputs, we get the following binomial option pricings: </p>
<br>        
<pre>
Call: $6.099
Put: $10.7344
        </pre>
        <p>
        Intuitively this makes some sense. Because the strike price is $10 more than the current price,
        for a call to be exercised in the money, it would have to go up. A put on the other hand would
        be able to stay the same/increase only a little bit. This gives the put intrinsic value today
        while the call does not.    
        </p>

        <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>
        <p>Monte Carlo simulations are ver similar to a binomial tree. The major difference
            is that we just a random 
            brownian motion to predict the price change in stock. From this we are also able to 
            estimate the price of options over time. 
        <br>
        Using the same parameters as above we obtained the following:

 </p>

<br>
        <pre>
        Call Price: $6.0104
        Put Price: $10.7616
        </pre>
        <p>This isn't very far off from our binomial tree and if you look at the streamlit yourself you can see
             a subset of all the random paths that we looked at to calculate the movement of the stock. 
             Interestingly enough, if you run this a couple times you'll actually get slightly different 
             answers everytime. 
            This is because of the inherent randomness of the stock price path. </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Black Scholes Merton</h2>
        <p>Now we are going to look at the most common way of calculating the price of stocks. 
            The Black Scholes Merton model is the closed solution to the partial differntial 
            equation that describes prices evolution of derivatives. This gives us a closed 
            form solution that with the right parameters allows us to calculate the fair value of options. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the app the Black Scholes feature comes with some other things that you can experiment with. 
        First is a heatmap that will show you how the price of a put/call will change as the volatility 
        and spot price change. Furthermore, you can look at a P/L graph for simple calls and puts as 
        the stock price increases.
        
        

 </p>

<br>
<p>To test the black schole smodel using the same parameters that we have throughout, we get: 
</p>
        <pre>
        Call Price: $6.04
        Put price: $10.68       
        </pre>
        <p>It is no conincedence that all of these are in a similar range. They all build off one another, some are just more accurate and easier to use than others. </p>
