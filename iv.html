        <h1 class="header">Implied Volatility Calculator</h1>
        <p>In this project I aimed to explore implied volatility, how it's calculated, and 
            its applications to trading and the market at large. A streamlit web interface
            where you can experiment with different tickers and see how it changes according
            to expiry/strike price can be found 

            <a href = "https://ivcalc.streamlit.app" target="_blank"> here</a>
            <br> <br>

            Implied volatility is the assumed volatility of a certain stock based on the current
            price of its own options. This can be extremely useful in trading and its application
            to strategies is endless. Calculating it is, in theory, pretty easy but in practice
            a little bit more difficult. calculating it comes down to solving the Black-Scholes Merton
            model for volatility based on the market price of options. Fortunately, with python, this is does
            done very simply with the minimize_scalar method as shown here: 
                <br> <br>
            <pre>
    result = minimize_scalar(objective, bounds=(1e-4, 5.0), method='bounded')
            </pre>

            All we are doing with this function is continually changing sigma until the 
            calculated strike price is ~= the market price. The sigma where this is the case 
            is the assumed volatility of the market.

            <br><br>
            
            If we want to see how the implied volatility changes for a stock like AAPL,
            it will look something like this:
            <br><br>

            <img src="/img/AAPL_IV.png" alt="AAPL Implied Volatility" width="600"/>


            <br><br>

            This is where implied volatility can be very useful. Options that are near expiration
            seem to have extremely high implied volatility which means that traders
            are likely expecting statistically significant movement in the next couple days.

            <br><br>

            This makes perfect sense as of the time of analyzing this, Apple is set to release
            their earnings in just about a week. This would explain the markets assumption of high
            fluctuations as the stocks reaction to unearnings is hard to predict. 

            <br><br>

            This is a prime example of how implied volatility can be useful in analyzing
            market trends and coming up with strategies.
